# GENERATING PDF FILES FROM PYTHON
## Introduction
Have you ever wondered how Udemy certificates work? How this one person is generating all these certificates in the blink of an eye? If you were wondering that the answer is that no person is generating these certificates, Udemy is built on Python, which means that many of Udemy tasks are automatic, like generating the certificates. This doesn't interact with the user and the only way we know what it does is by reading the code or opening the PDF file.

## FPDF Module
I have used the FPDF module to make these auto-generated PDF files. The way this module works is that you will use the module class FPDF class and add pages, you can add:
+ Lines
+ Text
+ Rectangles
+ And other shapes
